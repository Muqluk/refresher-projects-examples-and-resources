# How to Fork a Repository
  1. Open your preferred browser and navigate to the desired repository.  
  1. Located at the top right hand of the web page and just below the header you should see the 'Fork' button.  
      * Click the down arrow.  
      * Then click the 'Create a new fork' menu item shown below:<br />

        <br />
  1. This next screen presents you with _3 to 4 choices_ and a _Create fork_ button:
      * Individuals who are members of 1 or more organizations and/or with multiple github accounts may select the repository owner via dropdown menu selection <sup>`(Red Box & #1)`</sup>
      * Change the name of your copy of for **_your_** fork repo using the 'Repository Name' text box <sup>`(Green Box & #2)`</sup>
      * Copy only the `default branch` (most common is `master` or `main`) or to copy all branches from the original repo.  Default is to only copy the single branch shown below named `master` <sup>`(Yellow Box & #3)`</sup>
      * The label for choice #4 is unfortunately hidden behind the Owner dropdown.  Fortunately it is optional - you may change it if you wish however it can be changed at any time - so moving on...
      * When satisfied with your choices, click the `Create Fork` button. <sup>`(Orange Box & #5)`</sup>

  1. Barring network hiccups in transit or issues with Github servers you should now see the newly forked repository open in the browser in your selected account :rocket:
