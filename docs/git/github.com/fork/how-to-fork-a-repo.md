1. Open your preferred browser and navigate to the desired repository.

   * Click the down arrow.  
   * Then click the `Create a new fork` menu item shown below:<br />

1. This next screen presents  _3 to 4 choices_ and a _Create fork_ button:
   * Individuals who are members of 1 or more organizations and/or with multiple github accounts may select the repository owner via dropdown menu selection <sup>`(Red #1)`</sup>
   * Change the name of your copy of for **_your_** fork repo using the 'Repository Name' text box <sup>`(Green #2)`</sup>
   * Copy only the `default branch` (most common is `master` or `main`) or to copy all branches from the original repo.  Default is to only copy the single branch shown below named `master` <sup>`(Yellow #3)`</sup>
   * The label for choice #4 is unfortunately hidden behind the Owner dropdown.  Fortunately it is optional - you may change it if you wish however it can be changed at any time - so moving on...
   * When satisfied with your choices, click the `Create Fork` button. <sup>`(Orange #5)`</sup><br />

1. Barring network hiccups in transit or issues with Github servers you should now see the newly forked repository open in the browser in your selected account :rocket:
