# Refresher Projects

We will begin by spending the next several weeks in Visual Studio and C# primarily focusing on going over familiar territory with 3 notable exceptions:
1. You will learn Markdown as you will also be beginning to learn how to write documentation for your code which will be done in markdown (.md) files. 
3. **_Significant_** effort will be on all things .git
    * CLI commands
    * branching strategies
    * pull requests, both submitting as well as being a reviewer.
    * merge, rebase and cherry-pick, the similarities and differences, _when, why & how_ to use each, **and** when not to.
    
4. Writing Unit Tests using MSTest & learning Test Driven Development <sup>_(TDD)_</sup>
    * unit tests
    * integration tests
    *
